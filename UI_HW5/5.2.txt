Lifecycle hooks are essential in any JavaScript framework. 
All components have lifecycle hooks managed by Angular. 
Angular creates the hooks, renders them, creates and renders their children, checks when data-bound properties change, and destroys them before removing them from the DOM.

The main difference between constructor and ngOnInit is that ngOnInit is lifecycle hook and runs after constructor. 
Component interpolated template and input initial values aren't available in constructor, but they are available in ngOnInit.
