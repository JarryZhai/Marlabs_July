TypeScript Code is converted into Plain JavaScript Code. 
    TypeScript code is not understandable by the browsers. 
    Thats why if the code is written in TypeScript then it is compiled and converted the code. 
    By the help of JavaScript code, browsers are able to read the code and display.
JavaScript is TypeScript. 
    Whatever code is written in JavaScript can be converted to TypeScript by changing the extension from .js to .ts.
